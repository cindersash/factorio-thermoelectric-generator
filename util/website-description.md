# Thermoelectric Generator (Lava to Electricity)
Adds a new building to turn lava into electricity without needing any other resources like steam.

The building is a [thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator).
The generator "consumes" lava so you can put these back-to-back to transfer fluid easily, but one offshore pump can
only supply a limited number of these generators.

For balancing, this new building can only be constructed in a foundry and requires tungsten carbide.
